            <h2>What is an "Anonna?"</h2>
            <p>Annona itself does not refer to a singular fruit, but to a large genus of flowering and fruiting trees in the Annonaceae family. These fruiting trees are widespread throughout almost every continent in the world, and the most common over-arching name for fruits in this family is “custard apple,” but we will get more into the exact taxonomy below. As the common name suggests, the fruits of these annona trees typically have a custard-like texture when ripe. This is actually what prevents them from being widespread and commercially sold, since the fruits can easily damage during shipping if the fruit is shipped ripe.</p>
            <p>Odds are you may occasionally find a Cherimoya, annona cherimola, one of the more common annona fruits found in the West Coast, in your local grocery store once in a while, but those fruits are often picked early so they can be shipped when the fruits are still firm. To make sure an annona is ready to eat, you want to make sure it gives a little bit if you press on it, like an avocado. When sliced open, these fruits look like large, white, heart-shaped bowls of custard dotted with their black/brown seeds throughout, which can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts. Most trees in this family are fairly easy to sprout from their seeds, so if you get a chance to try the fruits try germinating the seeds. They do take their sweet time, however, and can take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to begin sprouting. Compared to most other tropical fruiting trees, these trees generally have a fast growth rate and can start flowering and fruiting in 2-4 years (there are exceptions, there are always exceptions…). </p>
            <p>Most of these trees thrive in tropical and subtropical environments, although there are some exceptions, such as the PawPaw (Asimina triloba), which is the largest native fruiting tree in the continental  United States. PawPaws are generally found in temperate climates, but can do good in subtropical environments as well. They also take much longer to fruit from seeds. The flowers of this species also have unique looking flowers, which are pollinated by small flying insects in their native areas. In the backyard garden, they may require hand pollination for better fruiting results, although they will be able to fruit without hand pollination when the trees reach a certain size. </p>

            <h2>Cherimoya</h2>
            <h6 class="quote">Annona cherimola</h6>
            <img class="image" alt="cherimoya" src="/static/annonas/cut-cherimoya.png">
            <p></p>
            <h4> Fruit Description </h4>
            <p>Depending on variety, the fruit can be scaly, bumpy, or relatively smooth with a relatively thin green-brown skin and white flesh scattered with black-brown seeds that should NOT be ingested and can be dangerous to consume. I personally have had cherimoya multiple times at different ripening stages. I love the flavor of cherimoya; it is like eating banana pudding with hints of pineapple, pear, and mango. Although I love the flavor, the texture is somewhat grainy, similar to an overripe European pear. Being more of a texture-person myself, I do not partciualarly appreciate how gritty the texture is when the fruit is ripe/overripe, so I prefer to eat the fruit a little bit before it fully ripens. This way the texture is chewier and less grainy and soft, although my mom prefers the fully ripened version because she doens't mind the graininess and values the elevated sweetness (Everyone's own preference for flavor, sweetness, tartness, texture, etc). The taste is most definetly worth it though, and I recommend you try a cherimoya yourself if you ever have the chance. </p>

            <h2>Sugar Apple</h2>
            <h6 class="quote">Annona squamosa</h6>
            <img class="image" alt="sugar apple" src="/static/annonas/sugarapple.png">
            <img class="image" alt="purple sugar apple" src="/static/annonas/purplesugarapple.png">
            <p></p>
            <h4> Fruit Description </h4>
            <p>This fruit often comes in two varieties: purple and green. Although I've only tried a green variety, it is said there is not a significant difference in flavor between the two. The sugar apple is appropriately named: it quite literally tastes like sugar with hints of vanilla and coconut. It is a very sweet fruit and I love the texture of it as well, which is juicy, slightly chewy yet smooth and soft, and I was left wanting more of this fruit. The only downsides of this fruit are that the fruit is about 1/2 the size of a cherimoya and much seedier as well, so the amount of actual edible pulp per fruit is about 1/4 of what you would get from a cherimoya. It is well worth it though, as the fruit is delicious and very satisfying to eat. Opening it is satisfying as well-when the fruit is ripe, you can simply use you hands and rip the scaly fruit into 2 halves and start eating the fruit. The scaly skin begins to peel as the fruit ripens and is signifciantly thicker than the cherimoya's thin skin.</p>

            <h2>Atemoya</h2>
            <h6 class="quote">Annona cherimola x squamosa</h6>
            <img class="image" alt="atemoya" src="/static/annonas/atemoya.png">
            <p></p>
            <h4> Fruit Description </h4>
            <p>The atemoya is a best-of-both-worlds hybrid of a cherimoya and a sugar apple. It has the cold-hardiness, large sized fruit, and excellent flesh-to-seed ratio of a cherimoya, with the superior texture and taste of a sugar apple. My family's consensus favorite annona that we have tried (between cherimoya, soursop, sugar apple, & atemoya) based on the overall taste, texture, edible pulp per fruit, and ease in growing. The texture, like sugar apple is juicy, chewy, and smooth. The taste was very sweet and sugary, but was more complex than the sugar apple with the essences of other fruits that the cherimoya has. There are no downsides of this fruit in my opinion, besides the fact that it is very expensive if found in US markets.</p>

        <div class="box2"> 
            <h2>Soursop</h2>
            <h6 class="quote">Annona muricata</h6>
            <img class="image" alt="soursop" src="/static/annonas/soursop.png">
            <p></p>
            <h4> Fruit Description </h4>
            <p> The soursop is a very, very interesting fruit. It has a spiky apperance and is often larger than a cherimoya, but is completely unique in terms of its flavor profile. The one soursop that I had the opportunity to try was a few days overripe, so the texture was a bit mushy, however, the taste and the unique fragrance were really good. I like sweet fruits, but I love fruits with complex flavors, and the soursop has a very complex flavor. Unlike the name suggests, the fruit is not particularly sour, it just contains a tartness component that doesn't exist in most other annonas. It had hints of mangosteen, coconut, pineapple, mango, guava, and smelled very floral. I can see this fruit making an excellent addition to a fruit salad, milkshake, or mixed juice. The texture of a perfectly ripe soursop is soft but not mushy and is not gritty, but more of fibrous in my opinion. Despite the one I had being past its prime, I enjoyed the soursop and I look forward to trying one again that is at peak ripeness. </p>
