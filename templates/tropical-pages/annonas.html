            <h2>What is an "Anonna?"</h2>
            <p>Annona itself does not refer to a singular fruit, but to a large genus of flowering and fruiting trees in the Annonaceae family. These fruiting trees are widespread throughout almost every continent in the world, and the most common over-arching name for fruits in this family is “custard apple,” but we will get more into the exact taxonomy below. As the common name suggests, the fruits of these annona trees typically have a custard-like texture when ripe. This is actually what prevents them from being widespread and commercially sold, since the fruits can easily damage during shipping if the fruit is shipped ripe.</p>
            <p>Odds are you may occasionally find a Cherimoya, annona cherimola, one of the more common annona fruits found in the West Coast, in your local grocery store once in a while, but those fruits are often picked early so they can be shipped when the fruits are still firm. To make sure an annona is ready to eat, you want to make sure it gives a little bit if you press on it, like an avocado. When sliced open, these fruits look like large, white, heart-shaped bowls of custard dotted with their black/brown seeds throughout, which can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts. Most trees in this family are fairly easy to sprout from their seeds, so if you get a chance to try the fruits try germinating the seeds. They do take their sweet time, however, and can take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to begin sprouting. Compared to most other tropical fruiting trees, these trees generally have a fast growth rate and can start flowering and fruiting in 2-4 years (there are exceptions, there are always exceptions…). </p>
            <p>Most of these trees thrive in tropical and subtropical environments, although there are some exceptions, such as the PawPaw (Asimina triloba), which is the largest native fruiting tree in the continental  United States. PawPaws are generally found in temperate climates, but can do good in subtropical environments as well. They also take much longer to fruit from seeds. The flowers of this species also have unique looking flowers, which are pollinated by small flying insects in their native areas. In the backyard garden, they may require hand pollination for better fruiting results, although they will be able to fruit without hand pollination when the trees reach a certain size. </p>
