    <p>Hi! My name is Ansh Bhatnagar and I am a first-year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I got into gardening through my parents, which at first was a chore I would be forced to do instead of being able to play Super Mario Bros on my Wii. However, I decided to make the most of the chore and applied my scientific mind to gardening, realizing it was nothing more than a year-long experiment. Eventually,  I began experimenting with new plants and varieties that we had never grown before, which expanded into a growing obsession with plants, more specifically, rare and rather unknown fruiting plants. Although growing plants can be physically straining, and often involve innumerable failures, I have found that the fruits are often worth the labor (literally) as most of the fruits that this world offers are not available in your local supermarket. Although I planted most of my plants awaiting a taste of the rare fruits that were typically unavailable for sale anywhere else, I've come to realize that the process is just as enjoyable (and frustrating) and makes the decade plus wait for some of the trees worth it. I write this blog to share my passion for plants and fruits with you all. </p>
